**AI Text Summarizer**
---------------------

**Project Overview:**

This project is an AI text summarization microservice built using:
1. Python
2. Flask (REST API layer)
3. Pydantic (schema validation)
4. Amazon Bedrock
5. Amazon Nova Micro LLM
The service accepts raw text input, validates it using structured schemas, sends a prompt to Amazon Nova Micro via Bedrock, and returns a structured JSON summary response.

**Problem Statement:**

Large documents, articles, and reports often require concise summaries for faster understanding and decision-making. Manually summarizing content is time-consuming and inconsistent.
This project solves the problem by:
 - Accepting raw text via API (Endpoint: /summarize)
 - Validating input format and constraints (pydantic validation)
 - Generating structured summaries using Amazon Nova Micro
 - Supporting multiple summarization styles
 - Returning measurable and structured output

**Amazon Nova Micro LLM**

The project uses Amazon Nova Micro, a lightweight and cost-efficient LLM available via Amazon Bedrock for the following reasons

- Optimized for low latency
- Cost-efficient
- Suitable for summarization and transformation tasks
- Fully managed through Bedrock

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**

The project supports multiple summarization styles via a dedicated prompt builder. **Check output screenshot folder to view the different response generated by the prompts**.
Instead of hardcoding prompts in the API layer, prompts are dynamically generated based on summary_type.

1. Concise Summary

Instruction:
Summarize in 3–5 clear sentences
Focus on core idea
Remove redundancy

Use Case:
Quick overview
Executive snapshot

2. Detailed Summary

Instruction:
Include key explanations
Preserve important insights
Maintain logical flow

Use Case:
Technical documents
Study material summaries

3. Bullet Point Summary

Instruction:
Structured bullet points
Clear separation of ideas
Compact formatting

Use Case:
Presentation preparation
Study notes

**Validation and Error Handling**

To prevent malformed inputs from reaching the LLM layer, following checks are done
 - Pydantic-based request validation
 - Structured 422 validation error responses
 - Exception handling decorators
 
**Future Enhancements**
 - Chunking support for long documents
 - Caching repeated summaries
 - Cost monitoring per request
 - ROUGE-based evaluation metrics
